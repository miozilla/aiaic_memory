This can significantly speed up the drug development process as these drugs have already undergone safety testing.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **Biotech Startups:** Numerous innovative startups are emerging, specifically focused on using AI for drug discovery (e.g., Atomwise, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Insilico Medicine, Exscientia).\n*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are actively partnering with or acquiring these AI-driven biotech firms to leverage their capabilities.\n*   **Focus on Specific Diseases:** Many AI drug discovery efforts are concentrating on challenging areas like neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), rare genetic disorders, and difficult-to-treat cancers.\n\n**Challenges and Future Outlook:**\n\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** The effectiveness of AI models relies heavily on high-quality, well-annotated biological and chemical data.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation in the lab and in clinical trials.\n*   **Regulatory Acceptance:** While progressing, regulatory pathways for AI-discovered or -designed drugs are still being refined.\n*   **\"Hallucinations\" in Generative AI:** Ensuring that generated molecules are not only novel but also chemically sound and synthesizable is crucial.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just an incremental improvement but a fundamental shift in how drugs are discovered. It's moving the field from a more trial-and-error approach to a more data-driven, predictive, and efficient process, with the ultimate goal of bringing life-saving therapies to patients faster.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Okay, let's dive deeper into the second development I mentioned: **Generative AI for Molecule Design**.\n\nThis is one of the most exciting and talked-about advancements in AI-driven drug discovery right now. It's moving beyond just analyzing existing data to actually *creating* new possibilities.\n\n**What is Generative AI in this Context?**\n\nThink of generative AI as an intelligent designer. Unlike traditional methods where chemists might modify existing drug structures or search vast databases for similar compounds, generative AI can:\n\n1.  **Learn the Rules of Chemistry and Biology:** It's trained on enormous datasets of known molecules, their properties, and their biological interactions. Through this training, it learns the fundamental principles of how atoms bond, how molecules fold, and what makes a molecule bind to a specific biological target (like a protein on a virus or a cancer cell).\n2.  **Generate Novel Structures:** Based on this learned knowledge, it can then propose entirely new molecular structures that have never been seen before. These generated molecules are designed with specific goals in mind.\n\n**How it Works (Simplified):**\n\nThere are several types of generative AI models used for this purpose, but a common approach involves:\n\n*   **Input:** You provide the AI with a \"target.\" This could be:\n    *   **A specific disease target protein:** \"Design a molecule that will bind tightly to the spike protein of this virus.\"\n    *   **Desired properties:** \"Design a molecule that is soluble, can cross the blood-brain barrier, and has a low probability of liver toxicity.\"\n    *   **A combination of both.**\n*   **The \"Generator\" Model:** This part of the AI creates new molecular structures (often represented as strings of text like SMILES or as 3D structures).\n*   **The \"Discriminator\" Model (in GANs):** This part acts like a critic, evaluating whether the generated molecules are realistic, chemically valid, and likely to have the desired properties. The generator and discriminator work together, with the generator trying to fool the discriminator into thinking its creations are real and effective.\n*   **Optimization:** The AI iteratively generates molecules, tests them against the defined criteria (often using predictive models for properties), and refines its output. It's like a rapid, automated brainstorming session.\n\n**Key Advantages of Generative AI in Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Speed:** It can propose thousands or millions of potential drug candidates in a fraction of the time it would take human chemists to synthesize and test them.\n*   **Novelty:** It can discover entirely new chemical spaces that human intuition might not explore, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies.\n*   **Multi-Objective Optimization:** It can simultaneously optimize for multiple desired properties (potency, selectivity, safety, solubility, etc.), which is very difficult with traditional methods.\n*   **Reduced Costs:** By narrowing down the pool of candidates for laboratory testing, it can significantly reduce the expensive experimental workload.\n\n**Examples of Applications:**\n\n*   **Designing new antibiotics:** Finding molecules that can overcome antibiotic resistance.\n*   **Creating targeted cancer therapies:** Designing molecules that specifically inhibit cancer cell growth while sparing healthy cells.\n*   **Developing antivirals:** Engineering compounds to block viral replication.\n*   **Finding treatments for neurological disorders:** Designing drugs that can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain.\n\n**Leading Companies and Progress:**\n\nCompanies like **Exscientia**, **Insilico Medicine**, **Atomwise**, and **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** are at the forefront of this technology. Some have already reported AI-designed drug candidates entering clinical trials, demonstrating that this is not just theoretical but a tangible part of the drug development pipeline.\n\n**The \"Generative\" Aspect:**\n\nThe key here is \"generative.\" The AI isn't just sorting or analyzing existing data; it's *generating* novel outputs that have never existed before. This creative potential is what makes it so powerful for discovering the next generation of medicines.\n\nIs there anything more specific you'd like to know about this particular development? For example, are you curious about the types of AI models used, the specific challenges, or the impact on the pharmaceutical industry?\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're right to ask about the companies!

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
